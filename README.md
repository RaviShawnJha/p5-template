# p5-template

This repo contains a template for working w/the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library/framework. For homework follow these steps:

1. "fork" this repo (click the fork button near the top-right hand corner of this page). once it's been forked to ur account clone ur fork of the repo down to ur computer.

2. once u have a local (ie. on ur computer) fork of this repo make a copy of the "template" folder && rename it w/ur name (remember, all lower case, no spaces)

3. u can now write ur p5 JavaScript in the "sketch.js" file of ur copied folder. to view ur sketch open the "index.html" (in the same folder) in a browser. as u make (&& save) changes to sketch.js u'll need to refresh the browser to see the updates.

4. when u're finished, open the "index.html" page that is in the root (ie. the main) directory, copy+paste the `<a...>` && `<br>` elements && change where it says "template" to the name of ur folder. lastly, submit a "pull-request" back to the original repo u forked from. ur homework is not considered complete until u've submitted ur pull-request.
